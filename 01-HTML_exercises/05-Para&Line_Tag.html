<body>
      <p>To be, or not to be, that is the question:<br/>
      Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer<br/>
      The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,<br/>
      Or to take Arms against a Sea of troubles,<br/>
      And by opposing end them: </p>

      <p>to die, to sleep;<br/>
      No more; and by a sleep, to say we end<br/>
      The heart-ache, and the thousand natural shocks<br/>
      That Flesh is heir to? 'Tis a consummation<br/>
      Devoutly to be wished. </p>

      <p>To die, to sleep,<br/>
      perchance to Dream; aye, there's the rub,<br/>
      For in that sleep of death, what dreams may come,<br/>
      When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,<br/>
      Must give us pause. There's the respect<br/>
      That makes Calamity of so long life:</p>

      <p>For who would bear the Whips and Scorns of time,<br/>
      The Oppressor's wrong, theproudman's Contumely,<br/>
      The pangs ofdispisedLove, the Lawâ€™s delay,<br/>
      The insolence of Office, and the spurns<br/>
      That patient merit of the unworthy takes,<br/>
      When he himself might his Quietus make<br/>
      With a bare Bodkin? </p>

      <p>Who would these Fardels bear, <br/>
      To grunt and sweat under a weary life,<br/>
      But that the dread of something after death,<br/>
      The undiscovered country, from whose bourn<br/>
      No traveller returns, puzzles the will,<br/>
      And makes us rather bear those ills we have,<br/>
      Than fly to others that we know not of.</p>

      <p>Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,<br/>
      And thus the native hue of Resolution<br/>
      Is sicklied o'er, with the pale cast of Thought,<br/>
      And enterprises of great pitch and moment, <br/>
      With this regard their Currents turn away,<br/>
      And lose the name of Action.</p> 
      
      <p>Soft you now,<br/>
      The fair Ophelia? Nymph, in thy Orisons<br/>
      Be all my sins remember'd.</p>
